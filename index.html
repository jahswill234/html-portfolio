    <h4>Solo Leveling</h4>
    <p>This is my favorite anime; I literally love the graphics and the storytelling.</p>

   <h4>Vikings</h4>
   <p>This is very enjoyable and a little touching; I really felt emotional watching it.</p>

   <h4>Avengers</h4>
   <p>An incredible movie — they went back in time to retrieve the stones to defeat Thanos.</p>

        <h3>What you should know when writing code:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>The computer will do exactly what you tell it; if your code is wrong, the computer will confidently execute that wrongness.</li>
            <li>Structure is everything (indentation, nesting, organization, hierarchy).</li>
            <li>Fail fast, fix faster (write -> test -> break -> debug -> test again).</li>
        </ul>
