        <h3>what you should know about when writting code:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>The Computer will do exactly what you say(if your code is wrong, <br />the computer will confidently excute that wrongness with a straight face.)</li>
            <li>Structure Is Everything(Indentation, Nesting, Organization,Hierarchy)</li>
            <li>Fail Fast, Fix Faster(you don't write perfect code, nobody does you write->test->break->debug->test again)</li>
        </ul>
